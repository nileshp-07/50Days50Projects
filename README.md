# 50 Days 50 Projects
Welcome to my "50 Days 50 Projects" repository! This repository contains a collection of projects created as part of the challenge to build one project each day for 50 days.

## Project List

1. **Day 1: Expanding Cards**
   - Description: The "Expanding Cards" project is an interactive web component that elegantly displays a set of cards. Clicking on a card smoothly expands it,
                  revealing additional content and creating a visually engaging user interface. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers a responsive and dynamic user experience.
